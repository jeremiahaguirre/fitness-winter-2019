## Main Takeaways

1 - Wordpress is a powerful CMS that allows you to create complex websites that are relatively easy to be updated by an end user.

2 - It is very important to understand the Wordpress Template Taxonomy in order to customize it.

3 - In a complex project like this, Sass features like nesting, mixins and variables become really important.

4 - I learnt the usage of :not in CSS in order to create rules exceptions.

5 - I practiced the use of grids to organize elements in table-like fashion.

6 -I appreciate the ability to mix PHP and HTML code in a .php file. This allows me to create pages with dynamic content and minimal hard coding.
